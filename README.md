# ðŸ”¥ SIEM with Splunk for Cyberattack Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Real-time security monitoring system capable of detecting:
- âœ… Brute force attacks
- âœ… Malware and ransomware
- âœ… Phishing attempts
- âœ… Web traffic anomalies

With Splunk correctly installed, we will run it.

 We will upload sample data (attack logs) and download sample logs
as we will use Apache logs simulating attacks:
Create a folder and download the logs.

and upload the logs to Splunk

I used this one. 


"wget https://github.com/logpai/loghub/raw/master/Apache/Apache_2k.log"


We have already uploaded the logs and now we have them.

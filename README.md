In this Splunk project, I will create a realistic lab where I will demonstrate  log collection (Windows, Linux, Firewalls), correlation rule creation (security alerts),  visual dashboards for forensic analysis, and response automation (e.g., blocking malicious IPs).

With Splunk correctly installed, we will run it.
